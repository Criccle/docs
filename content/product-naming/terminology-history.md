## Introduction

This document contains terms that are not used or have had their name changed.

## Cloud Portal {#cloud-portal}

This is an internal term and should not be used in the documentation or publicly, as it has not been agreed on or branded. It no longer appears in the Mendix Documentation or Mendix Platform Evaluation Guide.

Deployment facilities should be described within the name/context of the [Mendix Developer Portal](main-product-names##devportal) (for example, "deployment via the Developer Portal"). 

Describing the functionality should avoid using any "portal" language and emphasize the action of "deploying an app to the Mendix Cloud."

<!---
Two paragraphs above can also be considered guidelines, but are not included into note boxes. I think big sentences are easier to read when they are written in a paragraph and are not in a note.

## Community Edition {#community-edition}

The Mendix Community Edition was introduced with Mendix 5.18, which included the ability to deploy a Free App. This was replaced by the [Mendix Free Edition (DX Release)](https://www.mendix.com/blog/powering-continuous-innovation-with-the-mendix-free-edition/) in 2015, a move which was reinforced by [announcements at Mendix World 2019](https://www.mendix.com/blog/a-3-step-leap-into-your-digital-future-highlights-from-mendix-world/).
